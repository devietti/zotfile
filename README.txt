ZotFile: Zotero plugin to manage your attachments
by Joscha Legewie

ZotFile is a Zotero plugin that allows you to automatically rename, move, and attach pdf (or other) files to Zotero items by pressing a single button. The plugin supports batch renaming, user specified directories, renaming rules using metadata from Zotero items, and the organization of attachment files into subfolders. The plugin also syncs PDFs from your Zotero library to your (mobile) PDF reader (e.g. an iPad, Android tablet, etc.), and extracts highlighted text from pdfs to zotero notes (mac only).
